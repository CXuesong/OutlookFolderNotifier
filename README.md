# Outlook Folder Notifier

Shows notifications for some of the sub-folders in Outlook.

## Motivation

As it is commonly observed till Office 2016, though Outlook provides notification for new e-mails recieved in the "inbox" folder, it won't show such notifications for the received e-mails in any other folders (e.g. IMAP folders). Though there are already some tips on the internet to enable notifications for all incoming e-mails, sometimes we just want those which come into spam folder come silently. Thus I decided to spend a day writing this rudimentary Outlook add-in to solve the problem.
